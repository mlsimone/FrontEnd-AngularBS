# FrontSide

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.3.

## Development server

To Build: 

1) git clone ***.git off of gitHub
2) npm import *
where * = all the package dependencies listed in package.json.

For example, this project needs 
- bootstrap 5 
- Observables

3) modify styles.css and add-item-page.component.css 
to use the css files within the node_modules directory. This is a hard-coded (full path),

which will most likely different from the one checked into the repo which is based on my working
directory path (G:\documents\Training\ProofOfConcept\FrontEnd-AngularBS\node_modules).

4) Run 'ng serve' for a dev server
Run 'ng build' to build a production server  where artifacts will be stored in the 'dist/' directory.


Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
